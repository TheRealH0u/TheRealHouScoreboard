You slap them into OBS

Then you have a folder called matches. That's where you paste all the matches you gonna download from Challenger mode.

Like this: [Challenger mode Observer Package](https://help.challengermode.com/en/articles/5409712-how-to-use-the-observer-package)

Then you just slap those matches into matches folder. You can even rename them so you know better witch match is what.
And thats it.
