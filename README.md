## How to assemble the program

### How to set it up
When you extract the project in it you will find 6 files and 2 folders.  

#### Files for OBS
These files should be imported into OBS. You just drag them into OBS and then style then in OBS.  
- leftTeam.png
- leftTeam.txt
- rightTeam.png
- rightTeam.txt

### Folder matChes
The folder named matches is there to paste the matches in from Challengermode Observer package.  
For more info check out [this link](https://help.challengermode.com/en/articles/5409712-how-to-use-the-observer-package)     

In the previous program you had to rename the folder to the match name. So like match1, "one team" VS "another team" or any name.  

Now the program takes the team abbreviations and names the matches as so. For more read [Version 2.0](#version-20)  

## Questions

### How to extract multiple matches at the same time
Q: "When I download the match It's only one match and I don't want to extract every single .zip file one by one. How do I do that quicker?"  
So if you're using the program WinRar a pretty good extraction software you can actually extract multiple files at once.  
Just select all the files you want to extract. Right click on them and select "Extract each archive to separate folder"

### I dont really like the default icons
No problem you can change them your seld. Images are 256x256px and are stored in default folder under 0.png (left team) and 1.png (right team).
