# SneakyFoxesScoreboard
A quickly made custom Scoreboard for use in Challengermode Valorant games

## How does it work!
You have 4 files
- leftTeam.png
- leftTeam.txt
- rightTeam.png
- rightTeam.txt

You slap them into OBS

Then you have a folder called matches. That's where you paste all the matches you gonna download from Challenger mode.
"WeLl HoW dO i DoWnlOaD tHe ChaLleNgeR mOdE matChes"
Like this: [Challenger mode Observer Package](https://help.challengermode.com/en/articles/5409712-how-to-use-the-observer-package)

Then you just slap those matches into matches folder. You can even rename them so you know better witch match is what.
And thats it.

##Version 2.0
- Added a default folder where the default images for teams are stored.
- Updated the look of the program
- Games are no longer named by folder but are named by "one team" VS "another team"
